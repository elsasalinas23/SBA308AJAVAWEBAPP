# Athena's Clubhouse üêæ

Hi! Welcome to my little web app for SBA 308.  
This is a single-page project where you can:

- See a **live clock** (updates every second)  
- Pick a **cat partner** from a dropdown  
- Pick a **date and time**  
- Click **Book it**  
- See your **bookings** show up in a table (they also save in the browser so they don‚Äôt disappear when you refresh)  

When I choose a cat, I also fetch a **random cat photo** from *The Cat API*.  
This shows I can use `fetch` with `async/await` and work with an external API.

---

## How to run it
1. Open the project folder in VS Code.  
2. Right-click `index.html` and choose **Open with Live Server** (or just double-click to open in a browser).  
3. That‚Äôs it ‚Äî everything runs in the browser, no extra install needed.  

---

## Files / Folders---

## What I used
- **HTML + CSS** for structure and style  
- **JavaScript modules** (`type="module"`, with `import` and `export`)  
- **Fetch API** + **async/await** to grab a cat photo  
- **localStorage** so bookings stay saved after a refresh  

---

## Features that match the assignment
- ‚úÖ External API via `fetch` (The Cat API)  
- ‚úÖ User interaction (when I pick a cat, it fetches and shows a photo)  
- ‚úÖ Promises / async/await syntax  
- ‚úÖ Organized into multiple module files (`scripts.js`, `database.js`)  
- ‚úÖ Program runs without errors (basic validation and try/catch)  
- ‚úÖ Simple user experience with cards, table, and styled layout  
- *(Instructor said POST/PUT/PATCH is not graded, so I skipped that part)*

## How booking works
1. I pick a cat from the dropdown.  
2. I select a date and time.  
3. I click **Book it**.  
4. My booking appears in the table below.  
5. The booking is saved to `localStorage`, so it stays there even if I refresh.

## Stretch ideas (future improvements)
- Make sure the calendar only allows future dates  
- Add a favorites list for cat photos  
- Dark/light theme toggle for fun
